# Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree

### Gerardo Valencia Becerra

Repository containing my Udacity's [Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/predictive-analytics-for-business-nanodegree--nd008t) projects.

### Part 1: [Problem Solving with Advanced Analytics by Alteryx](https://www.udacity.com/course/problem-solving-with-advanced-analytics--ud976)

The Problem Solving with Analytics course provides students with the foundational knowledge to use data analytics to create business insights.

#### You will learn:

- To apply a useful framework to solve a business problem
- To determine which analytical method to apply given the nature of the problem and available data
- To use linear regression to generate business insights

Throughout this course you’ll also learn the techniques to apply your knowledge in a data analytics program called Alteryx. At the end of the course, you’ll complete a project based on the principles in the course.

### Part 2: [Creating an Analytical Dataset by Alteryx](https://www.udacity.com/course/creating-an-analytical-dataset--ud977)

Pawdacity is a leading pet store chain in Wyoming with 13 stores throughout the state. This year, Pawdacity would like to expand and open a 14th store. Your manager has asked you to perform an analysis to recommend the city for Pawdacity’s newest store, based on predicted yearly sales.

In the first part, you've already cleaned up the dataset and dealt with outliers.

In this project, you will take this dataset that you cleaned up and use this dataset to train a linear regression model in order to predict sales

Here are the criterias given to you in choosing the right city:

- The new store should be located in a new city. That means there should be no existing stores in the new city.
- The total sales for the entire competition in the new city should be less than $500,000
- The new city where you want to build your new store must have a population over 4,000 people (based upon the 2014 US Census estimate).
- The predicted yearly sales must be over $200,000.
- The city chosen has the highest predicted sales from the predicted set.

Understand the most common data types. Understand the various sources of data. Make adjustments to dirty data to prepare a dataset. Identify and adjust for outliers. Learn to write queries to extract and analyze data from a relational database.

### Part 3: [Classification Models by Alteryx](https://www.udacity.com/course/classification-models--ud978)

You are a loan officer at a young and small bank (been in operations for two years) that needs to come up with an efficient solution to classify new customers on whether they can be approved for a loan or not. You'll use a series of classification models to figure out the best model and provide a list of creditworthy customers to your manager.

#### Skills Required
In order to complete this project, you must be able to:

Cleanup, format, and blend a wide range of data sources
Build predictive classification models using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Boosted Model
