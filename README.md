# Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree

### Gerardo Valencia Becerra

Repository containing my Udacity's [Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/predictive-analytics-for-business-nanodegree--nd008t) projects.

### Part 1: [Problem Solving with Advanced Analytics by Alteryx](https://www.udacity.com/course/problem-solving-with-advanced-analytics--ud976)

The Problem Solving with Analytics course provides students with the foundational knowledge to use data analytics to create business insights.

#### You will learn:

- To apply a useful framework to solve a business problem
- To determine which analytical method to apply given the nature of the problem and available data
- To use linear regression to generate business insights

Throughout this course you’ll also learn the techniques to apply your knowledge in a data analytics program called Alteryx. At the end of the course, you’ll complete a project based on the principles in the course.

### Part 2: [Creating an Analytical Dataset by Alteryx](https://www.udacity.com/course/creating-an-analytical-dataset--ud977)

Pawdacity is a leading pet store chain in Wyoming with 13 stores throughout the state. This year, Pawdacity would like to expand and open a 14th store. Your manager has asked you to perform an analysis to recommend the city for Pawdacity’s newest store, based on predicted yearly sales.

In the first part, you've already cleaned up the dataset and dealt with outliers.

In this project, you will take this dataset that you cleaned up and use this dataset to train a linear regression model in order to predict sales

Here are the criterias given to you in choosing the right city:

1. The new store should be located in a new city. That means there should be no existing stores in the new city.
2. The total sales for the entire competition in the new city should be less than $500,000
3. The new city where you want to build your new store must have a population over 4,000 people (based upon the 2014 US Census estimate).
4. The predicted yearly sales must be over $200,000.
5. The city chosen has the highest predicted sales from the predicted set.

### Part 3: [Classification Models by Alteryx](https://www.udacity.com/course/classification-models--ud978)

You are a loan officer at a young and small bank (been in operations for two years) that needs to come up with an efficient solution to classify new customers on whether they can be approved for a loan or not. You'll use a series of classification models to figure out the best model and provide a list of creditworthy customers to your manager.

#### Skills Required
In order to complete this project, you must be able to:

-Cleanup, format, and blend a wide range of data sources
-Build predictive classification models using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Boosted Model

### Part 4: [A/B Testing](https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud979)

You're a business analyst for Round Roasters, a coffee restaurant in the United States of America. The executive team conducted a market test with a new menu and needs to figure whether the new menu can drive enough sales to offset the cost of marketing the new menu. Your job is to analyze the A/B test and write up a recommendation to whether the Round Roasters chain should launch this new menu.

#### Skills Required

In order to complete this project, you must be able to:

1. Cleanup, format, and blend a wide range of data sources
2. Plan and analyze A/B tests

### Part 5: [Combining Predictive Techniques](https://www.udacity.com/course/predictive-analytics-for-business-nanodegree--nd008t)

The capstone project has three main tasks, each of which requires you to use skills you developed during the Nanodegree program:

#### Task 1: Store Format for Existing Stores

Your company currently has 85 grocery stores and is planning to open 10 new stores at the beginning of the year. Currently, all stores use the same store format for selling their products. Up until now, the company has treated all stores similarly, shipping the same amount of product to each store. This is beginning to cause problems as stores are suffering from product surpluses in some product categories and shortages in others. You've been asked to provide analytical support to make decisions about store formats and inventory planning.

#### Task 2: Store Format for New Stores

The grocery store chain has 10 new stores opening up at the beginning of the year. The company wants to determine which store format each of the new stores should have. However, we don’t have sales data for these new stores yet, so we’ll have to determine the format using each of the new store’s demographic data.

#### Task 3: Forecasting

Fresh produce has a short life span, and due to increasing costs, the company wants to have an accurate monthly sales forecast. You’ve been asked to prepare a monthly forecast for produce sales for the full year of 2016 for both existing and new stores.
